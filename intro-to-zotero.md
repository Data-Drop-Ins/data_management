# Introduction to Zotero

This workbook is designed to accompany the Personal and Professional Development module HUMPR027 - Referencing Without Tears.

## Working with References
In an extended document, such as a PhD thesis, the number of unique works referred to or cited can easily reach 1,000 items. Each of these items may be cited on more than one occasion, and some texts frequently throughout. Managing the sequence of references, particularly in footnotes, where abbreviated titles might be used for subsequent citation, can easily lead to confusion and errors, even in single sections of the thesis.

For example:

> 10 Ann E. Austin, 'Cognitive Apprenticeship Theory and Its Implications for Doctoral Education: A Case Example from a Doctoral Program in Higher and Adult Education', International Journal for Academic Development, 14 (2009), 173-83.

Subsequent references might be:
> 15 Austin, 'Cognitive Apprenticeship Theory’, 178-9.

But what happens if you need to refer to the same work three pages earlier than the first citation?

You will need to change not only the numbering of the footnotes (which your word processor will do for you, fortunately), but the first citation (footnote 10) now has to be abbreviated and the full abbreviation appears as an earlier footnote.

Imagine doing this with 1,000 unique bibliographic items.

- Reference management software is designed to make this process considerably easier by providing a repository for the bibliographic items you are referring to, and it works with word processing packages, such as Microsoft Word, to allow you to easily select the correct item and automatically format for the place in the text, without manual adjustments. If citations are deleted or added, the formatting is instantaneous – the software will do that for you.

- A second major advantage of reference management software is its standardised format for references. Using a range of templates compatible with the structure of bibliographic records in libraries and data repositories, it is very easy to download references directly into the software, so minimising data entry.

- The third, and possibly most important long-term advantage of such software is its flexibility. Although the format of bibliographic records is standardised, the style of referencing varies greatly depending on your discipline, country in which you are studying, and almost certainly where you might be publishing your research. Style guides for academic publications are notoriously idiosyncratic. Powerful software, such as EndNote, allows authors to not only download and use output styles that are widely known and accepted, but also to customise styles for their own needs.

## Getting Started with Zotero

Zotero and Mendeley are superficially very similar to EndNote. They are both repositories for references, they use the same set of file formats (notably .ris files, mentioned earlier), and they allow the user to create citations using a word processor plugin. Where these platforms differ from EndNote are in their emphasis on sharing references, so much of the setup for Zotero and Mendeley is aimed at a social approach to scholarship. In fact, Mendeley, for instance looks more like a social media platform than bibliographic software.

Although Zotero has an open source [ethos](https://github.com/zotero) and a strong community of users, there are limitations to the amount of data that you can store (300MB), after which you will need to pay for an [upgrade](https://www.zotero.org/storage?id=storage).

### Creating a Zotero Account

To get the most out of Zotero, it is recommended that you create an [account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). This allows users to take advantage of the online storage option, and access Zotero Groups.

## Zotero Groups

Zotero’s sharing ethos is reflected in its groups function. Groups allow you to create bibliographies that can be shared with other people in your team, either for teaching or joint research projects. Some groups are public, and can be shared [globally](https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group). You might find a group that interests you.

For this exercise, we will use the group 'uea_test_group', for which you will receive a invitation and link to join before the session.

### Creating a Zotero Group

When you are logged in, click on the Groups tab, then ‘Create a New Group’.

Zotero provides different privacy settings for Groups. These are ‘Public, Open Membership’, ‘Public, Closed Membership’, and ‘Private Membership’. If you are selective about who you would like to join your group, you might be interested in closed membership, or even private. You will also need to provide a name for your group, so that it can be identified in the Zotero search feature. You may need to be creative with the naming, as group names are unique.

You can also assign file editing permissions to your group, so users can contribute or change records in the bibliographies, or restrict it to just the group administrators. When you are ready, just select ‘Save Settings’.

Records are held in your ‘Group Library’. You can manually add records to the Group Library, as below.

Alternatively, synchronising your libraries with the Zotero desktop application allows you to import and amend records. Just open the Zotero desktop application, which should synchronise your Groups automatically upon start up.

### Joining a Zotero Group

For this exercise, you should have received an invitation to join the 'uea_test_group' Zotero Group. Navigate to the relevant library, and then use ‘File’ > ‘Import’ to import a bibliographic file of your choice (see section below for further details).

## Importing References into the Zotero Client

### Using the Zotero Connector to Import References

As a lot of research is conducted through a web browser, a lot of reference management software has plugins or connectors that allow a browser to recognise content on a web page that can be formatted as a reference (for instance, a newspaper article or a new book description on a publisher’s website).

The [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/) can be downloaded for different browsers, but was optimized for use with Firefox.

After downloading the connector, you should see a new icon on the toolbar at the top right of your browser. In the example below, clicking on the connector icon allows the browser to identify the publication on the web page.

A notification informs the user that the reference is being saved automatically to Zotero (the desktop application needs to be open at this stage). You might notice that the bibliographic details imported into the fields are inaccurate, so the automatic import is not perfect. However, it you happen across something quickly online, it is a useful way of keeping a record of what you find.

Try opening a web page and importing a reference. Can the Connector recognise the type of item that is imported?

Just like a library catalogue, Zotero acknowledges different types of items in the collection, and distinguishes between journal articles, edited books, conference proceedings and so on. When adding a new item manually or editing an item, you can change the reference type by clicking on an item in the library and then selecting the 'Item Type' field.

### Importing References from a File

The layout of Zotero is very similar to EndNote, so the interface will be quite familiar to you by now. In the central panel is the list of references, on the right is the reference record, and on the left the list of folders that contain references.

The import process from a .ris file is virtually identical to EndNote. Simply go to ‘File’ > ‘Import’ and locate the file on your device. Zotero uses the designation ‘Library’ for the structure of the reference database, and the folders are called ‘collections’. As mentioned above, Zotero favours sharing libraries with other researchers, so you will see that as well as a local library folder structure, you may have a ‘group library’ structure as well. This allows you to share your references with others.

If you would like to import an example file for use in the following section, you can download and use the file 'doctoral_education.ris', which is available in the relevant Learning Materials folder on the Blackboard site.

## Checking and Editing References

Try searching the ‘Author’ field for works that contain ‘Kelly’. You should find two works by Frances Kelly.

Select the first item and examine the pane on the right. This pane contains all of the fields in that bibliographic record, even those that do not contain any data. 

You will see some familiar information: the author’s name, the year of publication of the work, the title, and the title of the journal that the work was published in.

Now look for ‘Kiley’ instead of ‘Kelly’. You should find four items. 

What do you notice about the first item?

The ‘Author’ field is a bit unusual. This is what it contains: 

> author, Margaret Kiley Corresponding 

> Mullins, Gerry 

In this case, the field has not been formatted well and some work needs to be done to make this appear correctly in your finished bibliography and for each citation.

Click on the ‘Author’ field in the ‘Reference’ pane on the right. Delete ‘author,’ and ‘Corresponding’ and type in ‘Kiley, Margaret’ on the first line. Leave ‘Mullins, Gerry’ on the second line. 

Zotero registers separate authors on separate lines, so in multi-author works, remember to follow this structure. Look at the second reference on the list, by ‘Ayers’, and you will see a list of five authors.

## Citations Using Zotero

Zotero also has a [plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration) for word processors. For this example, we will use Microsoft Word, but you can also use Zotero with other open source word processors, such as LibreOffice.

Ensure that you have installed the plugin for Word on your device and open a new Word document.

### Adding Footnotes

Type in some text into the body of the Word document, and add a footnote at the end of the sentence.

In the footer, next to the first footnote, click ‘Add/Edit Citation’. Select the Citation Style when prompted. We will choose ‘Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition (note)’ for this example. Ensure that ‘Display Citations As:’ is set to ‘Footnotes’ and click ‘OK’.

Unlike EndNote, which has a search window for references, Zotero uses a floating search box.

Type in ‘Kozar’ again and select the reference.

When the reference appears in the search box, press ‘enter’ and the citation will appear in the footnote. You will notice that this ‘note’ format is an abbreviated version of the authors and title of the work. To change this to a full version, click on ‘Document Preferences’, then select the ‘full note’ version of Chicago. Now click ‘OK’. This should update the note.

### Adding Pagination to Citations

You can change the pagination in each citation very easily. Just click ‘Add/Edit Citation’ and select the relevant reference. When you click on the reference, you will be prompted to provide a page range. Add the required pages and press ‘enter’. This will automatically add in the page numbers to the reference.

### Adding In-Text Citations

If you are using in-text citation for your work (e.g. APA, Harvard), then you can use the Zotero plugin in the same way as with footnotes, but in the main body of the text instead.

In your Word document, find an appropriate place in the text to insert the citation. Click on the 'Document Preferences' option in the Zotero tab and choose the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition, author-date style.

This change will convert previous and new references to an in-text citation style. Click on the Zotero tab and 'Add/Edit Citation', then search for 'Powell' and insert the 2007 citation.

### Reference Lists

All scholarly texts will require some form of reference list, or bibliography. Inserting and updating a list of references in Zotero is very simple, and saves a lot of manual checking.

In your Word document, find a line to insert your reference list. Then click 'Add/Edit Bibliography'.

When you insert or delete citations in your document, the reference list will update to reflect these changes automatically.
